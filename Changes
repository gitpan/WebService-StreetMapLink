- Google Maps now support the United Kingdom.


0.06    2005-02-08

really has the Google bits.


0.05    2005-02-08

- Added a Priority() class method to handle the case when two
subclasses handle the same country(ies).

than Mapquest.


0.04    2004-12-07

- A prereq, Class::Factory::Util, was missing from the Build.PL file.


0.03    2004-12-07

- streetdirectory.com.sg now forbids deep linking in their TOS, and
the URLs generated by this module stopped working.  So it now uses
catcha.com.sg for Singapore maps (which under the hood uses
streetdirectory ;).  streetdirectory.com.au still works, and their TOS
do not forbidx deep linking.


0.02

- Renamed to WebService::StreetMapLink (from WWW::Map).

- When given a country that no subclass can handle, it now simply
returns false instead of dying.

- Added support for France to Multimap subclass.

- First release.
