0.2    2007-08-04

- Added a service_name() method to allow you to identify an
  object. This can be useful if you need to generate text describing a
  link, like "See a map on $service_name".

- Expanded list of countries for Google to include all countries
  listed here -
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps#Coverage_details - as of
  August 4, 2007. Google also seems to work for Singapore and
  Switzerland, despite those not being on that list.

- Removed Streetdirectory for Australia. They've changed the URIs
  again, and there's no easy way to link directly to a
  map. Fortunately, Google now handles Australia.

- Catcha appears to be defunct, and Multimap no longer makes it easy
  to link directly to a specific map.

- This means that this module now uses Google Maps as the preferred
  service for all map links. Otherwise the only option is MapQuest, as
  all the other services have either died or made deep link impossible
  or outside their TOS.


0.10    2006-05-21

* Subclasses now must call RegisterSubclass() to register
  themselves. This is backwards-incompatible with previous
  versions. If you have a local subclass you are using, it will stop
  working unless you change it.

- The above change makes it possible to load and use a subclass
  directly. Reported by Mark Stosberg.

- Added missing URI 1.28 prereq.


0.09    2005-05-23

- Only use first 5 digits of US zip codes for Google links.


0.08    2005-05-06

- Prefer Google to MapQuest for Canada.

- The address string passed to Google now includes the country name.


0.07    2005-04-20

- Google Maps now supports the United Kingdom.


0.06    2005-02-08

- Forgot to update the MANIFEST before uploading 0.06.  This one
  really has the Google bits.


0.05    2005-02-08

- Added a Priority() class method to handle the case when two
  subclasses handle the same country(ies).

- Support for Google Maps in the USA.  Google has a higher priority
  than Mapquest.


0.04    2004-12-07

- A prereq, Class::Factory::Util, was missing from the Build.PL file.


0.03    2004-12-07

- streetdirectory.com.sg now forbids deep linking in their TOS, and
  the URLs generated by this module stopped working.  So it now uses
  catcha.com.sg for Singapore maps (which under the hood uses
  streetdirectory ;).  streetdirectory.com.au still works, and their
  TOS do not forbidx deep linking.


0.02

- Renamed to WebService::StreetMapLink (from WWW::Map).

- When given a country that no subclass can handle, it now simply
returns false instead of dying.

- Added support for France to Multimap subclass.


0.01    2004-07-09

- First release.
